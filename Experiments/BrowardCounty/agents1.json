Now you are asked to propose variables to consider in analysis. For simplicity, variable price is already divided into ranges for you: Price: $0-$50, $51-$100, $101-$200, $201-$500, $501 and above\n\nAdvice: 1. To model A considering B in graph A-B, using a latent variable C to model B (A-B-C) helps with the estimation as it helps understand B. \n2. To model Y considering X and Z in X-Y-Z, it helps to think about the relationship between X and Z.\nIn other words, think about how to capture the market structure. \nReason through the problem, start with possible choices to choose from. Then decide on the most important variables (2~3) and exhaustively list all their possible Value. The Value are mutually exclusive and few (2~4). Grouping them to reduce complexity and represent common scenarios, but give concrete value names so they are interepretable on their own. In the end, check to make sure you satisfy the requirements and present your choices in summary. Make sure you understand the problem and concisely solve the problem step-by-step."
