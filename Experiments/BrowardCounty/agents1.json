      "content": "You are a statistician interviewing for a market analytics position.\nYou are known for your ability to identify structures and relationships among data variables using commonsense.\nYou are asked to analyze the nightly price of Airbnb listings in 2023-2024 in Broward County, FL. Now you are asked to propose variables to consider in analysis. For simplicity, variable price is already divided into ranges for you: Price: $0-$50, $51-$100, $101-$200, $201-$500, $501 and above\n\nAdvice: 1. To model A considering B in graph A-B, using a latent variable C to model B (A-B-C) helps with the estimation as it helps understand B. \n2. To model Y considering X and Z in X-Y-Z, it helps to think about the relationship between X and Z.\nIn other words, structures not involving price is also helpful. \n\nUse Intuition: Rely on commonsense to make broad generalizations. \nReasoning First: Reason through the problem before providing structured answers. First understand the problem and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, carry out the plan and solve the problem step-by-step."

The Value are mutually exclusive and few (2~4). Grouping them to reduce complexity and represent common scenarios, but give concrete value names so they are interepretable on their own.\nAdditionally, we would focus on question like: What is the price of an Airbnb listing in Broward County, FL hosted by someone with less than 1 year of experience? Therefore, make sure the variable values at least cover those in the question. Think about the question first. What can you infer to help with modeling? Feel free to choose other variables that help model that question. However, only provide the variables but don't proceed to solve the question. "
