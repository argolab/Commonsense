          "content": "To estimate the distribution of nightly prices for Airbnb listings in an urban area of Broward County, FL, we can make some reasonable assumptions based on common knowledge:\n\n1. $0-$50: It is unlikely to find many listings in an urban area for less than $50 per night, as urban areas generally have higher living costs. Let's assume a probability of 5%.\n\n2. $51-$100: This price range is more common for budget-conscious travelers looking for affordable accommodations in urban areas. Let's assume a probability of 30%.\n\n3. $101-$200: This range is likely to be the most common for urban Airbnb listings, catering to a wide range of travelers. Let's assume a probability of 50%.\n\n4. $201-$500: Listings in this price range are expected to be upscale accommodations or larger properties in desirable urban locations. Let's assume a probability of 13%.\n\n5. $501 and above: It is rare to find listings priced above $500 per night in an urban area, usually reserved for luxury properties or unique accommodations. Let's assume a probability of 2%.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\n1. Probability of $0-$50: 5%\n2. Probability of $51-$100: 30%\n3. Probability of $101-$200: 50%\n4. Probability of $201-$500: 13%\n5. Probability of $501 and above: 2%\n\nSum of probabilities: 5% + 30% + 50% + 13% + 2% = 100%\n\nTherefore, the estimated probabilities for the nightly prices of Airbnb listings in an urban area of Broward County, FL are:\n- $0-$50: 5%\n- $51-$100: 30%\n- $101-$200: 50%\n- $201-$500: 13%\n- $501 and above: 2%\nYou should extract 5 probabilities, in the order of $0-$50, $51-$100, $101-$200, $201-$500, $501 and above."

This range is likely to be quite popular among budget-conscious travelers.\n\n3. **$101-$200**: Listings in this range would likely include more upscale private rooms, entire homes, or apartments with better amenities and possibly better locations. This range may cater to travelers looking for a bit more comfort and convenience.\n\n4. **$201-$500**: This range would likely include high-end accommodations such as luxury apartments, beachfront properties, or spacious homes with premium amenities. These listings would cater to travelers seeking a more luxurious experience.\n\n5. **$501 and above**: This range would represent the most exclusive and luxurious listings in Broward County, FL. These could include luxury villas, high-end penthouses, or unique properties with exceptional amenities and services.\n\nNow, let's assign some probabilities to each price range based on the assumptions above:\n\n1. **$0-$50**: 0.4\n2. **$51-$100**: 0.3\n3. **$101-$200**: 0.2\n4. **$201-$500**: 0.1\n5. **$501 and above**: 0.0\n\nThese probabilities sum to 1, as required.\n\nTherefore, the estimated probabilities for the nightly prices of Airbnb listings in Broward County, FL with basic amenities categorized by price ranges are:\n- $0-$50: 0.4\n- $51-$100: 0.3\n- $101-$200: 0.2\n- $201-$500: 0.1\n- $501 and above: 0.0\nYou should extract 5 probabilities, in the order of $0-$50, $51-$100, $101-$200, $201-$500, $501 and above."

Let's estimate a probability of 20% for this range.\n\n2. **$51-$100**: This range might be common for new hosts looking to offer affordable options while covering their costs. Let's estimate a probability of 40%.\n\n3. **$101-$200**: Some new hosts may aim for mid-range prices to compete with established hosts and offer more amenities. Let's estimate a probability of 30%.\n\n4. **$201-$500**: It is less likely for new hosts to have listings in this price range, but some may offer larger or more luxurious properties. Let's estimate a probability of 8%.\n\n5. **$501 and above**: New hosts are unlikely to have listings priced above $500 per night, reserved for very high-end or unique properties.
