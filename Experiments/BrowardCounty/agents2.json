Collect data on Airbnb listings in Broward County, FL that offer luxury amenities.\n2. Categorize the nightly prices into the specified ranges.\n3. Calculate the probabilities for each price range.\n\n**Carrying out the plan:**\n1. Collect data on Airbnb listings in Broward County, FL that offer luxury amenities.\n2.
