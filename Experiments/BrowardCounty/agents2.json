We can estimate that a smaller percentage of listings will offer premium amenities. Let's estimate this probability to be around 0.08.\n\n4.

Basic amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, TV): These are essential amenities that most Airbnb listings are expected to have. It is safe to assume that a high percentage of listings in Broward County, FL will offer basic amenities. Let's estimate this probability to be around 0.6.\n\n2. Standard amenities (e.g., kitchen, air conditioning): Standard amenities are common in many Airbnb listings and are expected by most guests. We can estimate that a moderate percentage of listings will offer standard amenities. Let's estimate this probability to be around 0.3.\n\n3. Premium amenities (e.g., pool, hot tub): Premium amenities are more luxurious and desirable, but not as common as basic and standard amenities. We can estimate that a smaller percentage of listings will offer premium amenities. Let's estimate this probability to be around 0.08.\n\n4. Luxury amenities (e.g., private chef, gym): Luxury amenities are rare and only found in high-end listings. We can estimate that a very small percentage of listings will offer luxury amenities. Let's estimate this probability to be around 0.02.\n\nNow, let's verify that these probabilities sum up to 1:\n0.6 (Basic) + 0.3 (Standard) + 0.08 (Premium) + 0.02 (Luxury) = 1\n\nTherefore, the estimated probabilities for the breakdown of the types of amenities offered in Airbnb listings in Broward County, FL are as follows:\n- Basic amenities: 0.6\n- Standard amenities: 0.3\n- Premium amenities: 0.08\n- Luxury amenities: 0.02\nYou should extract 4 probabilities, in the order of Basic (e.g., Wi-Fi, TV), Standard (e.g., kitchen, air conditioning), Premium (e.g., pool, hot tub), Luxury (e.g., private chef, gym)."

Probability of $501 and above: 5%\n\nThese probabilities sum up to 100%, providing a reasonable estimate of the distribution of nightly prices for condos listed in Broward County, FL.\nYou should extract 5 probabilities, in the order of $0-$50, $51-$100, $101-$200, $201-$500, $501 and above."

This range is very low for the area, so the probability is very low, let's say 5%.\n\n2. **$51-$100**: This range is more plausible for a listing hosted by someone with less than 1 year of experience in Broward County. It is common for new hosts to offer competitive prices to attract guests. Let's assign a probability of 40% to this range.\n\n3. **$101-$200**: As hosts gain more experience and positive reviews, they tend to increase their prices. However, for hosts with less than 1 year of experience, this range is still reasonable, especially for properties with good amenities or locations. Let's assign a probability of 45% to this range.\n\n4. **$201-$500**: It is less likely for a new host in Broward County to price their listing in this range unless they have a very high-end property or unique features. Let's assign a probability of 8% to this range.\n\n5. **$501 and above**: It is highly unlikely for a host with less than 1 year of experience to price their listing above $500 in Broward County, unless it is a luxury property or a special event rental. Let's assign a probability of 2% to this range.\n\nIn conclusion, the estimated probabilities for the price ranges of an Airbnb listing in Broward County, FL hosted by someone with less than 1 year of experience are as follows:\n- $0-$50: 5%\n- $51-$100: 40%\n- $101-$200: 45%\n- $201-$500: 8%\n- $501 and above: 2%"

This range is very low for the area, so the probability is very low, let's say 5%.\n\n2. **$51-$100**: This range is more plausible for a listing hosted by someone with less than 1 year of experience in Broward County. It is common for new hosts to offer competitive prices to attract guests. Let's assign a probability of 40% to this range.\n\n3. **$101-$200**: As hosts gain more experience and positive reviews, they tend to increase their prices. However, for hosts with less than 1 year of experience, this range is still reasonable, especially for properties with good amenities or locations. Let's assign a probability of 45% to this range.\n\n4. **$201-$500**: It is less likely for a new host in Broward County to price their listing in this range unless they have a very high-end property or unique features. Let's assign a probability of 8% to this range.\n\n5. **$501 and above**: It is highly unlikely for a host with less than 1 year of experience to price their listing above $500 in Broward County, unless it is a luxury property or a special event rental. Let's assign a probability of 2% to this range.\n\nIn conclusion, the estimated probabilities for the price ranges of an Airbnb listing in Broward County, FL hosted by someone with less than 1 year of experience are as follows:\n- $0-$50: 5%\n- $51-$100: 40%\n- $101-$200: 45%\n- $201-$500: 8%\n- $501 and above: 2%\nYou should extract 5 probabilities, in the order of $0-$50, $51-$100, $101-$200, $201-$500, $501 and above."
