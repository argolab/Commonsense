We are given five price ranges: $0-$50, $51-$100, $101-$200, $201-$500, and $501 and above. We need to calculate the probabilities of listings falling into each of these price ranges.\n\n**Plan to Solve the Problem:**\n1. Collect data on Airbnb listings in rural areas of Broward County, FL.\n2. Categorize the listing prices into the specified price ranges.\n3.

Obtain the data for Airbnb listings in Broward County, FL that offer premium amenities like a pool or hot tub.\n2. Filter the listings based on the premium amenities.\n3.

        "content": "**Understanding the Problem:**\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the distribution of Airbnb listing prices in rural areas of Broward County, FL, and categorize them into different price ranges. We are given five price ranges: $0-$50, $51-$100, $101-$200, $201-$500, and $501 and above. We need to calculate the probabilities of listings falling into each of these price ranges.\n\n**Plan to Solve the Problem:**\n1. Collect data on Airbnb listings in rural areas of Broward County, FL.\n2. Categorize the listing prices into the specified price ranges.\n3. Calculate the probabilities of listings falling into each price range.\n4. Ensure that the sum of probabilities is equal to 1.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Let's assume we have collected data on 100 Airbnb listings in rural areas of Broward County, FL.\n2. After categorizing the prices, let's say we have the following distribution:\n   - $0-$50: 20 listings\n   - $51-$100: 30 listings\n   - $101-$200: 35 listings\n   - $201-$500: 10 listings\n   - $501 and above: 5 listings\n3. Calculate the probabilities for each price range:\n   - Probability of $0-$50: 20/100 = 0.2\n   - Probability of $51-$100: 30/100 = 0.3\n   - Probability of $101-$200: 35/100 = 0.35\n   - Probability of $201-$500: 10/100 = 0.1\n   - Probability of $501 and above: 5/100 = 0.05\n4. Verify that the sum of probabilities is equal to 1:\n   0.2 + 0.3 + 0.35 + 0.1 + 0.05 = 1\n\n**Answer:**\nThe probabilities of Airbnb listings in rural areas of Broward County, FL falling into the specified price ranges are approximately:\n- $0-$50: 0.2\n- $51-$100: 0.3\n- $101-$200: 0.35\n- $201-$500: 0.1\n- $501 and above: 0.05\n\nThese probabilities sum up to 1."
