Target an Condition also consist of names and possible values. Probability denotes conditional or unconditional probabilities in interval or number. \\nFor example, if there is P(Y=y1|X=x1)=0.9, then Target has Variable Y with Value y1, and Condition Variable X Value x1, and a probability of 0.9. \\nIf there are multiple conditions in the value, then we are conditioning on the collection of them: P(Y=y1|X=x1 or X=x2) then Condition has Variable X Value x1, x2.\\nThere can also be no conditions, like P(X=x1), and then Condition is left empty.\\n For simplicity, we also have Batch notation:\\nIf conditioned on x1 probability of y1 is 0.7 and of y2 is 40%-50%, then we use BatchTarget with Name Y and Values y1, y2. In this case there is BatchProbability which must has two entries, 0.7 and [0.4, 0.5].\\n When transcribing for records, always provide the existing Variables, but provide only the latest constraints (exclude constraints from previous dialogues). \\n There would also be query to the record, in which case you should provide a format similar to the records. The question may have slightly different wording, but you are to provide a query JSON appropriate to the question to the extent allowed by the Variable defitions, without making additional assumptions. \\nAfter the initial training warmup (with hints), you will start converting the actual dialogue.
