Target an Condition also consist of names and possible values. Probability denotes conditional or unconditional probabilities in interval or number. \\nFor example, if there is P(Y=y1|X=x1)=0.9, then Target has Variable Y with Value y1, and Condition Variable X Value x1, and a probability of 0.9. \\nIf there are multiple conditions in the value, then we are conditioning on the collection of them: P(Y=y1|X=x1 or X=x2) then Condition has Variable X Value x1, x2.\\nThere can also be no conditions, like P(X=x1), and then Condition is left empty.\\n For simplicity, we also have Batch notation:\\nIf conditioned on x1 probability of y1 is 0.7 and of y2 is 40%-50%, then we use BatchTarget with Name Y and Values y1, y2. In this case there is BatchProbability which must has two entries, 0.7 and [0.4, 0.5].\\n When transcribing for records, always provide the existing Variables, but provide only the latest constraints (exclude constraints from previous dialogues). \\n There would also be query to the record, in which case you should provide a format similar to the records. The question may have slightly different wording, but you are to provide a query JSON appropriate to the question to the extent allowed by the Variable defitions, without making additional assumptions. \\nAfter the initial training warmup (with hints), you will start converting the actual dialogue.

      "### Devising a Plan\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understand the Market Context**: Airbnb listings vary widely based on location, type of accommodation, amenities, and other factors. Private rooms tend to be cheaper than entire homes or apartments.\n",
      "2. **Consider Typical Pricing**: For private rooms with up to 3 beds, we can expect the prices to be on the lower to mid-range side.\n",
      "3. **Estimate Probabilities**: Use intuition and common sense to distribute the probabilities across the given bins.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Carrying Out the Plan\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Market Context and Typical Pricing**:\n",
      "   - Private rooms are generally less expensive than entire homes or apartments.\n",
      "   - Listings with up to 3 beds suggest smaller accommodations, which are typically less expensive.\n",

      "2. **Estimate Probabilities**:\n",

      "   - **$51 - $100**: This is a reasonable price range for private rooms, especially in less expensive cities or for more basic accommodations.\n",
      "   - **$101 - $200**: This range would likely cover more amenities or better locations.\n",
      "   - **$201 - $400**: Less common for private rooms, but possible in very high-demand areas or luxury properties.\n",
      "   - **$401 and above**: Very rare for private rooms, likely to be a very small percentage.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Assign Probabilities**:\n",
